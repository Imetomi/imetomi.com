------------   EXPERIENCE AND PROJECTS   ------------  
I acquired most of my knowledge and skills outside of institutional education, which is probably due 
to my curious nature. I started working in the field of artificial intelligence and autonomous flying 
robots at the age of 16 and have been actively developing my ideas ever since.

- Brainwave-controlled wheelchair robot and videogame (1st prize at the 25th Youth Scientific and Innovational Contest)
- Intelligent human and face recognizing autonomous drones that can find injured people autonomously in rural areas. 
(Award winning project in Taiwan)
- Hand gesture-based home automation and smart home systems (SciChallange Winner - Vienna)
- Brain activity-controlled obstacle avoiding drones.
- Created a backtest environment in Python (using Pandas, NumPy and Plotly) with an interactive dashboard that 
allows to test and analyze algorithmic trading strategies with multiple instruments.



------------   WORK EXPREINCE AND FREELANCER PROJECTS   ------------  
My work experience comes from freelancer projects which I did mostly for Hungarian
and American clients. Most of these projects are related to embedded systems
programming and computer vision.
In 2021 I started a tech company and grew our team's size to 26 at one point. 
Right now we are focusing on Quino (quino.ai) with a smaller team.
